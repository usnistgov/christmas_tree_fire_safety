# Christmas Tree Heat Release Rate (HRR)

The Department of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland
hosts an annual competition to predict the burning behavior (heat release rate,
HRR) of a Fraser Fir Christmas tree from ignition to final burnout. More
information about this competition can be found at:
<https://fpe.umd.edu/events/christmas-fire-safety-demo>.

On this page, you can ‘build’ (and submit) your own Christmas tree fire HRR
prediction for this year’s competition by adjusting four parameters that
define: fire growth rate, peak heat release, the duration of steady burning,
and fire decay.


For over two decades, the Fire Research Division at NIST has supported
Christmas tree fire safety awareness by conducting multiple burn experiments
using both dry and wet trees.  Using measurement science based on oxygen
consumption calorimetry, researchers are able to quantify how rapidly a burning
tree releases energy (heat release rate). 

These experiments are part of a of a larger fire science program to 1) support
and promote better public awareness of fire safety during the holiday season
and 2) highlight relevant research projects and tools – both experimental[^1]
and modeling[^2] – that are developed to quantify the behavior of fire and to
reduce the impact of fire on people, property, and the environment.

This competition also provides a platform for open communication between
members of the fire safety science community. This competition provides an
opportunity to encourage and motivate current researchers and the next
generation of scientists and engineers to explore and develop collaborations
related to emerging areas of fire safety science.
